This contains my career stuff

In 2025 it is very difficult to get an entry level job in tech. This repo markets my career and documents my journey of self improvement as well as career improvement. Hopefully whoever reads this understands or even sympathizes with my perseverance and unwillingness to quit security.

This repo will be a basis for me to share my coding journey that began in February 7th 2025 as well as config files ive written myself. Any use of AI in any project will be commented and I will include such in my documentation and write ups on projects. 

Thanks for viewing my personal github repo!
